# ACTIONS Examples

**This folder contains several actions examples, from the very simple ones to ridiculously complicated.**

Use them as is, or as guideline to build your own config.yaml.

To use them, replace all your `actions:` block with one of these, with careful not to replace the following block, `iv_regexes`.

## Sorting Table

**This is the order in which Pokemon displays pokémons when sorting by A-Z. Useful for working out a custom order you'd like to view your pokémons.**

_For Gboard users, the character in parenthesis indicates which key on Gboard contains the character in question (with tap&hold)._

### Per device differences

**Characters above with `[A]` or similar at the end means that the order changes depending on the device. Yeah...**

The letter between the brackets is the device's "type" _(more like mood)_, so if your phone follows pattern [A], you should disregard characters labeled as [B]. In other words, it's either one, or the other.
