# ACTIONS Examples

**This folder contains several actions examples, from the very simple ones to ridiculously complicated.**

Use them as is, or as guideline to build your own config.yaml.

To use them, replace all your `actions:` block with one of these, with careful not to replace the following block, `iv_regexes`.
