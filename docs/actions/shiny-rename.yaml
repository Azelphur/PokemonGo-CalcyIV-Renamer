    #  not refined. If you care, just remove 'iv_max__ge: 80' below and it will appraise every pokemon
    #  that has an IV Range.

        iv_max__ge: 80
      actions:
        rename: "+ {calcy}"

    # Every other shiny that's IV 79 or less gets renamed like so:

        rename: "± {calcy}"

    # Renames anything else that doesn't matches any rule above, which shouldn't happen.
    #   The script should never get here, but this is good practice: if you find a pomemon
    #   renamed like this it means there was an error in your logic below and the pokemon
    #   didn't match any condition.
